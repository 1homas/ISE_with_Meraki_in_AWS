# Device Types from https://nmap.org/book/osdetect-device-types.html
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# - name: general_purpose
#   description: This category contains general-purpose operating systems like Linux and Windows. In the nmap-service-probes file this class is indicated by a lack of a d// field. 

# - name: bridge
#   description: A bridge combines two or more subnetworks into one. With a bridge this happens at a lower level than with a router. This category also includes things like Ethernet-to-serial bridges. 

# - name: broadband_router
#   description: Devices in this category connect a network to the Internet via cable, ADSL, fiber optics, etc. Some of these devices provide network address translation, a firewall, port forwarding, or other services. 

# - name: firewall
#   description: A firewall controls what traffic is allowed into or out of a network. Some also have additional capabilities. This category doesn't include general-purpose operating systems that happen to come with a firewall, but it does include OS distributions purpose-built to work only as a firewall. 

# - name: game_console
#   description: A video game console like the Xbox or PlayStation. 

# - name: hub
#   description: A hub joins network segments by re-broadcasting all traffic. Hubs are distinct from switches, which selectively transmit packets only to relevant destinations. 

# - name: load_balancer
#   description: A device that distributes inbound traffic to multiple devices to ease the load on those devices. 

# - name: media_device
#   description: This category includes all kinds of audiovisual equipment, including portable music players, home audio systems, TVs, and projectors. 

# - name: PBX
#   description: A private branch exchange, or PBX, routes telephone calls within a private organization and connects them to the public telephone network or VoIP. 

# - name: PDA
#   description: A handheld computer. Devices that are also telephones go in the "phone" category. 

# - name: phone
#   description: A network-capable telephone that is not a VoIP phone. Devices in this category are typically mobile phones. 

# - name: power-device
#   description: Miscellaneous power devices like uninterruptable power supplies and surge protectors. 

# - name: printer
#   description: Network-enabled printers, including printers with an embedded print server. 

# - name: print_server
#   description: A print server connects a printer to a network. Printers that contain their own print server go in the "printer" category instead. 

# - name: proxy_server
#   description: Any kind of proxy, including web proxies and other servers that cache data or understand high-level protocols. 

# - name: remote_management
#   description: Devices that allow servers or other equipment to be monitored or managed remotely. 

# - name: router
#   description: Routers connect multiple networks. They are distinct from hubs and switches because they route packets between different networks as opposed to extending one network. 

# - name: security-misc
#   description: Any security device that doesn't fall into the “firewall” category belongs in this category. This includes intrusion detection and prevention systems. 

# - name: specialized
#   description: The catch-all category. If a device doesn't fall into one of the other categories, it is specialized. Examples in this category are diverse and include such things as clocks, oscilloscopes, climate sensors, and more. 

# - name: storage-misc
#   description: Data storage devices like tape decks and network-attached storage appliances. 

# - name: switch
#   description: A device that extends a network by selectively re-broadcasting packets. Switches are distinct from hubs, which broadcast all packets. 

# - name: telecom-misc
#   description: Devices used by telephone systems that aren't PBXs, like voicemail and ISDN systems. 

# - name: terminal
#   description: A device with a keyboard and monitor with the primary purpose of communicating directly with a terminal server or mainframe. 

# - name: terminal_server
#   description: A device providing terminal facilities to clients over a network. 

# - name: VoIP_Adapter
#   description: A device that converts between voice over IP (VoIP) protocols and normal telephone traffic. Also may convert different VoIP protocols. 

# - name: VoIP_Phone
#   description: A phone capable of a VoIP protocol. 

# - name: WAP
#   description: Wireless access points offer a wireless connection to a network. Most work with radio technology like 802.11b but some use infra-red or something else. Devices that could also be put in another category, like wireless broadband routers, are put in the WAP category because WAPs require special network considerations. 

# - name: webcam
#   description: Any kind of camera that stores or transmits pictures or video. This includes everything from consumer webcams to security system cameras.
